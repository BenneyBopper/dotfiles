### Prerequisites

You'll need to have these on your machine for these dotfiles to be useful...

* git ([Everyone's favourite distributed RCS](http://git-scm.com))
* zsh ([Zed-S-H! Zish? Better than bash.](http://www.zsh.org))
* oh-my-zsh ([robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh))

### Let's see it in action!
